JView provides the programmer with the ability to quickly develop 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional visualization applications that are tailored to address a specific problem.</li><li>Major technologies used: Java, JOGL, OpenGL.</li><li>JView is used by numerous developers from the DOD and DOD contractors.</li></ul></p></div><div><p><b>Evaluation Highlights:</b></p><p><ul><li><b>JView seems very stable</b>. We could not get it to crash unexpectedly. The stability is good, but letting the user know what error is happening is not so good (see the next question).</li><li><b>The documents are clear to understand</b>. The main documentation help is the demobrowser application, which has descriptions, source code and runnable examples of over 120 different uses of the API.</li><li><b>The original developers do not have the resources to support the asset</b> as an enterprise asset. They will continue to support questions through forge.mil as they always have and respond as able.</li></ul></p></div><div><p><b>ID2E Summary:</b></p><p>JView was found to be a very useful and an easy tool to use. Getting started is easy because of the demobrowser application which has 120+ application examples that include a full description, source code, and a run-able sample application. The source code can be copied verbatim to create an application quickly, or modified to whatever extent the developer desires. The samples include everything from creating a basic universe and 3D graph, shaders, creating any type of models, capturing animation, geographical visualization, and many more possibilities. It is a very extensive tool and easy to put to use. However, some of the evaluation aspects that could receive a high evaluation fall short.</p></div></div><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td class="success" colspan="2"><h4>External Dependencies</h4><tr><td width="50%">WebLogic server<td width="50%">Optional deployment container</table><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td class="success" colspan="2"><h4>Location of Asset Artifacts</h4><tr><td width="50%">Home Page<td width="50%">https://extranet.rl.af.mil/jview/</table></div><div class="col-md-3"><div class="table-responsive"><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td class="success" colspan="3"><h4>Component Scoring</h4><tr><td rowspan="2"><h4>Overall Score</h4><td colspan="2"><h4>46.7</h4><tr><!-- <td >&nbsp;</td> --><td colspan="3">Out of 100<tr><td colspan="3">&nbsp;<tr><td width="60%">Discoverable<td width="10%">2<td width="30%">icon<tr><td>Accessible<td>2<td>icon<tr><td>Documentation<td>2<td>icon<tr><td>Deployable<td>2<td>icon</table><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td class="success" colspan="2"><h4>Component Vitals</h4><tr><td width="50%">Supported OS<td width="50%">Same as Java 1.5+<tr><td>VM Support<td>Yes<tr><td>VM Support<td>Yes<tr><td>License<td>JView license (CAC Card Required)<tr><td>SvcV-4 Alignment<td>2.2.1.2 Widget Framework<tr><td>JCA Alignment<td>6.2.3.8 Enterprise Application Software<tr><td>JCSFL Alignment<td>8.9.5 Integrate Enterprise Applications</table><table class="table table-bordered"><tbody><tr><td class="success" colspan="2"><h4>Points of Contact</h4><tr><td width="50%">Supported OS<td width="50%">Same as Java 1.5+</table></div></div><div class="col-md-1"></div></div></div></div>
